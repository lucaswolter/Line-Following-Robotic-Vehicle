# Line-Following-Robotic-Vehicle
#### Intro to Electrical Engineering Final Project
Course taken Spring 2019 with Professor Briggs. Project completed in collaboration with Bryan Wong.
- Programmed TI Robotics System Learning Kit vehicle using Energia to follow along curving black line path
- Determined capacitive discharging time necessary to distinguish light & dark surfaces with array of 8 IR sensors
- Controlled motor speeds with PID using IR sensor array to track position of black line path relative to the vehicle
